Guidelines when modifying PyVern:

* NEVER distribute illegal / malicious copies of PyVern.
	- It is illegal to make such stuff like that.
	- I will take action once a copy is reported to me.
	- This can go the same with forks of the repository.

* NEVER request a PR for insert malicious payloads / malware.
	- Every PR in this repository gets researched and looked into.
	- Once malicious payloads are found, we will decline / close the PR.
