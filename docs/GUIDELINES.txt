Guidelines when modifying PyVern:

* NEVER distribute illegal / malicious copies of PyVern.
	- It is illegal to make such stuff like that.
	- I will take action once a copy is reported to me.
	- This also applies to modules.

* DO NOT use PyVern and custom scripts as a weapon for threat.
	- Threatening to hack in a false manner can be 
	  enough to scare everyone, and it'd even cause 
	  you to get in legal trouble.

* NEVER EVER make scripts into real exploits.
	- Action will be taken once a script / module this 
	  category gets found out.
	- This is also a form of (probably) distributing
	  malware, since exploits can be malicious to
	  devices sometimes.
